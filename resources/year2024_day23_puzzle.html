Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @was.tl on Bluesky, @ericwastl@hachyderm.io on
Mastodon, and @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 23: LAN Party ---</h2><p>As The Historians wander around a secure area at Easter Bunny HQ, you come across posters for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_party" target="_blank">LAN party</a> scheduled for today! Maybe you can find it; you connect to a nearby <a href="/2016/day/9">datalink port</a> and download a map of the local network (your puzzle input).</p>
<p>The network map provides a list of every <em>connection between two computers</em>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>kh-tc
qp-kh
de-cg
ka-co
yn-aq
qp-ub
cg-tb
vc-aq
tb-ka
wh-tc
yn-cg
kh-ub
ta-co
de-co
tc-td
tb-wq
wh-td
ta-ka
td-qp
aq-cg
wq-ub
ub-vc
de-ta
wq-aq
wq-vc
wh-yn
ka-de
kh-ta
co-tc
wh-qp
tb-vc
td-yn
</code></pre>
<p>Each line of text in the network map represents a single connection; the line <code>kh-tc</code> represents a connection between the computer named <code>kh</code> and the computer named <code>tc</code>. Connections aren't directional; <code>tc-kh</code> would mean exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>LAN parties typically involve multiplayer games, so maybe you can locate it by finding groups of connected computers. Start by looking for <em>sets of three computers</em> where each computer in the set is connected to the other two computers.</p>
<p>In this example, there are <code>12</code> such sets of three inter-connected computers:</p>
<pre><code>aq,cg,yn
aq,vc,wq
co,de,ka
co,de,ta
co,ka,ta
de,ka,ta
kh,qp,ub
qp,td,wh
tb,vc,wq
tc,td,wh
td,wh,yn
ub,vc,wq
</code></pre>
<p>If the Chief Historian is here, <em>and</em> he's at the LAN party, it would be best to know that right away. You're pretty sure his computer's name starts with <code>t</code>, so consider only sets of three computers where at least one computer's name starts with <code>t</code>. That narrows the list down to <code><em>7</em></code> sets of three inter-connected computers:</p>
<pre><code>co,de,<em>ta</em>
co,ka,<em>ta</em>
de,ka,<em>ta</em>
qp,<em>td</em>,wh
<em>tb</em>,vc,wq
<em>tc</em>,<em>td</em>,wh
<em>td</em>,wh,yn
</code></pre>
<p>Find all the sets of three inter-connected computers. <em>How many contain at least one computer with a name that starts with <code>t</code>?</em></p>
